# OpenAPI 3 Contract First Example

A sample application demonstrating how to create an OpenAPI 3 contract first application.
 In this example, we will define the API with OpenAPI YAML first.  Using the openapi-codegen
 project, the scaffolding of the controller will be created.  Then, Spring Cloud Contract
 stubbings will also be generated.  This will allow for automatic verification of the
 producer API.
 
## TODO

* Figure out how to use generics
* Verify Pageable parameters in contract
